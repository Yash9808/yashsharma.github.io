I am **Yash Sharma**, and I have completed my PhD viva at [**Loughborough University**](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/), where I was affiliated with the [**Intelligent Automation Lab**](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/research/intelligent-automation/).

My research focuses on developing **tactile perception systems for robotics** using **machine learning techniques** inspired by **biological sensory mechanisms**. Specifically, my work draws on concepts from **mechanoreception** and **threshold-based encoding** to create **bio-inspired approaches** for enhancing robotic touch and perception.
