I am Yash Sharma, and I have completed my PhD viva at Loughborough University, where I was affiliated with the Intelligent Automation Lab: Intelligent Automation.
My research focuses on developing tactile perception systems for robotics using machine learning techniques inspired by biological sensory mechanisms. Specifically, my work draws on concepts from mechanoreception and threshold-based encoding to create bio-inspired approaches for enhancing robotic touch and perception.
